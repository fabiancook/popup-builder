**How many popups can I create?**

You can create as many popups as you want, there is no limit either on the Free or the PRO version.

You can have as many popups as you want on the same page, but you can only set one popup to be opened on page load, the others must be set to open on click.

**How can I set a popup to open automatically?**

After creating your popup, go to the desired page or post and you will see a meta box below the content editor, with the following title: "Select popup on page load". Select the popup you want to set and then update the page. You are done! After you go to that page/post the popup will get opened automatically.
